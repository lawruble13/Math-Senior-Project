Through simple encodings from such domains into the set of words over a finite alphabet these problems can be converted into language recognition problems, and we can inquire into their computational complexity. It is reasonable to consider such a problem satisfactorily solved when an algorithm for its solution is found which terminates within a number of steps bounded by a polynomial in the length of the input. We show that a large number of classic unsolved problems of covering, matching, packing, routing, assignment and sequencing are equivalent, in the sense that either each of them possesses a polynomial-bounded algorithm or none of them does.",

One possible generalization of this problem is to relax the continuity condition the variables. This paper presents a simple numerical algorithm for the solution of programming problems in which some or all of the variables can take only discrete values. The algorithm requires no special techniques beyond these used in ordinary linear programming, and lends itself to automatic computing. Its use is illustrated on two numerical examples.},

Finally, the use of valid inequalities for classes of problems with structure, such as network design, is explored."

The proposed method, namely, the discrete variable MPS (D-MPS) method, differs from its continuous variable version not only on sampling in a discrete space, but moreover, on a novel double-sphere strategy. The double-sphere strategy features two hyperspheres whose radii are dynamically enlarged or shrunk in control of, respectively, the degree of “exploration” and “exploitation” in the search of the optimum. Through testing and application to design problems, the proposed D-MPS method demonstrates excellent efficiency and accuracy as compared to the best results in literature on the test problems. The proposed method is believed a promising global optimization strategy for expensive black-box functions with discrete variables. The double-sphere strategy provides an original search control mechanism and has potential to be used in other search algorithms.}",
